# ISM012-042-PHDi

### Abstract
Hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PHD) inhibitors have been approved for treating renal anemia, yet have failed clinical testing for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to lack of efficacy. We use multimodel multimodal generative AI platform to design an orally gut-restricted selective PHD1/2 inhibitor, which exhibitsted favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in preclinical studies. ISM012-042 restoresd intestinal barrier function and alleviatesd gut inflammation in multiple experimental colitis models.

### exp_matrix
Expression matrix (count, TPM) from ISM012-042 project (GEO access: GSE280622). Around 100 mg of colon tissues were collected from sham or TNBS-induced colitis mouse models treated with either vehicle or ISM012-042 on day 2 post-colitis induction.
